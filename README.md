Welcome to Ontology's source code repository!

Ontology is dedicated to develop a high-performance blockchain infrastructure which is customizable to different business requirements. 

Prerequisites for getting started with development on the Ontology networks are:

- Mainstream coding and development experience
- Understanding of your business scenario/requirements
- NO need for previous Blockchain Engineer experience

The Ontology core tech team, the community and the ecosystem can all support you in development. MainNet, TestNet, SmartX and a Docker imange for Ontology, SmartX and Ontology Explorer combined makes it easy to start.

Ontology makes getting started easier!

The code is currently Alpha phase of the release life cycle, but rapidly under development for Beta. The master code may be unstable, but stable versions can be found under the [release page](https://github.com/ontio/ontology/releases).

We sincerely welcome developers to Ontology.

## Features

- Scalable lightweight universal smart contract
- Scalable WASM contract support
- Crosschain interactive protocol (processing)
- Multiple encryption algorithm support
- Highly optimized transaction processing speed
- P2P link layer encryption (optional module)
- Multiple consensus algorithm support (VBFT/DBFT/RBFT/SBFT/PoW)
- Quick block generation time

## Build development environment
The requirements to build Ontology are:

- Golang version 1.9 or later
- Glide (a third party package management tool)
- Properly configured Go language environment
- Golang supported operating system

## Get Ontology
### Get from release
- You can download latest ontology binary file with ` curl https://dev.ont.io/ontology_install | sh `.

- You can download other version at [release page](https://github.com/ontio/ontology/releases).

### Get from source code

Clone the Ontology repository into the appropriate $GOPATH/src/github.com/ontio directory.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ontio/ontology.git
```
or
```
$ go get github.com/ontio/ontology
```
Fetch the dependent third party packages with glide.

```
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ontio/ontology
$ glide install
```

Build the source code with make.

```
$ make all
```

After building the source code sucessfully, you should see two executable programs:

- `ontology`: the node program/command line program for node control
- `tools/sigsvr`: (optional)Ontology Signature Server - sigsvr is a rpc server for signing transactions for some special requirement.detail docs can be reference at [link](./docs/specifications/sigsvr.md)

## Run ontology

### Mainnet sync node

Run ontology straightly

   ```
	./ontology
   ```
Then you can connect to ontology mainnet.

### Public test network Polaris sync node

Run ontology straightly

   ```
	./ontology --networkid 2
   ```
   
Then you can connect to ontology public test network.


### Testmode

Create a directory on the host and store the following files in the directory:
- Node program `ontology`
- Wallet file`wallet.dat` (`wallet.dat` can be generated by `./ontology account add -d`)

Run command `$ ./ontology --testmode` can start single-host test net.

Here's a example of single-host configuration:

- Directory structure

    ```shell
    $ tree
    └── ontology
        ├── ontology
        └── wallet.dat
    ```

### Run in docker

Please ensure there are docker environment in your machine.

1. make docker image

    - In the root directory of source code，run`make docker`, it will make ontology image in docker.

2. run ontology image

    - Use command `docker run ontio/ontology`to run ontology；

    - If you need to allow interactive keyboard input while the image is running, you can use the `docker run -ti ontio/ontology` command to start the image;

    - If you need to keep the data generated by image at runtime, you can refer to the data persistence function of docker (e.g. valume);

    - If you need to add ontology parameters, you can add them directly after `docker run ontio/ontology` such as `docker run ontio/ontology --networkid 2`.
     The parameters of ontology command line refer to [here](./docs/specifications/cli_user_guide.md).

## Some example

### ONT transfer sample
 -- from: transfer from； -- to: transfer to； -- amount: ont amount；
```shell
 ./ontology asset transfer  --from=ARVVxBPGySL56CvSSWfjRVVyZYpNZ7zp48 --to=AaCe8nVkMRABnp5YgEjYZ9E5KYCxks2uce --amount=10
```
If transfer asset successd, the result will show as follow:

```shell
Transfer ONT
  From:ARVVxBPGySL56CvSSWfjRVVyZYpNZ7zp48
  To:AaCe8nVkMRABnp5YgEjYZ9E5KYCxks2uce
  Amount:10
  TxHash:437bff5dee9a1894ad421d55b8c70a2b7f34c574de0225046531e32faa1f94ce
```
TxHash is the transfer transaction hash, we can query transfer result by txhash.
Because of generate block time, the transfer transaction will not execute befer at least generate one block.

If you want to transfer ONG, just add --asset=ong flag.

Note that ONT hasn't decimal, and ONG has 9 decimal.

```shell
./ontology asset transfer --from=ARVVxBPGySL56CvSSWfjRVVyZYpNZ7zp48 --to=ARVVxBPGySL56CvSSWfjRVVyZYpNZ7zp48 --amount=95.479777254 --asset=ong
```
If transfer asset successd, the result will show as follow:

```shell
Transfer ONG
  From:ARVVxBPGySL56CvSSWfjRVVyZYpNZ7zp48
  To:AaCe8nVkMRABnp5YgEjYZ9E5KYCxks2uce
  Amount:95.479777254
  TxHash:e4245d83607e6644c360b6007045017b5c5d89d9f0f5a9c3b37801018f789cc3
```

Note that all the place that use address of account, can use index or label of account. Index is the sequence number of account in the wallet, and the index start from 1. Label is the unique alias of account in wallet.

```shell
./ontology asset transfer --from=1 --to=2 --amount=10
```

### Query transfer status sample

```shell
./ontology info status <TxHash>
```

For Example:

```shell
./ontology asset status --hash=10dede8b57ce0b272b4d51ab282aaf0988a4005e980d25bd49685005cc76ba7f
```

result：

```shell
Transaction:transfer success
From:AXkDGfr9thEqWmCKpTtQYaazJRwQzH48eC
To:AYiToLDT2yZuNs3PZieXcdTpyC5VWQmfaN
Amount:10
```

### Query account balance sample

```shell
./ontology asset balance <address|index|label>
```

For Example:

```shell
./ontology asset balance ARVVxBPGySL56CvSSWfjRVVyZYpNZ7zp48
```

or

```shell
./ontology asset balance 1
```
result：
```shell
BalanceOf:ARVVxBPGySL56CvSSWfjRVVyZYpNZ7zp48
  ONT:989979697
  ONG:28165900
```

## Contributions

Please open a pull request with a signed commit. We appreciate your help! You can also send your code as emails to the developer mailing list. You're welcome to join the Ontology mailing list or developer forum.

Please provide detailed submission information when you want to contribute code for this project. The format is as follows:

Header line: explain the commit in one line (use the imperative).

Body of commit message is a few lines of text, explaining things  in more detail, possibly giving some background about the issue  being fixed, etc.

The body of the commit message can be several paragraphs. Please do proper word-wrap and keep columns shorter than 74 characters or so. That way "git log" will show things  nicely even when it is indented.

Make sure you explain your solution and why you are doing what you are  doing, as opposed to describing what you are doing. Reviewers and your  future self can read the patch, but might not understand why a  particular solution was implemented.
