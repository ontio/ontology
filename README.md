## Build development environment
The requirements to build Ontology are:

- Golang version 1.9 or later
- Glide (a third party package management tool)
- Properly configured Go language environment
- Golang supported operating system

## Get Ontology
### Get from source code

Clone the Ontology repository into the appropriate $GOPATH/src/github.com/ontio directory.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ontio/ontology.git
```
or
```
$ go get github.com/ontio/ontology
```
Fetch the dependent third party packages with glide.

```
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ontio/ontology
$ glide install
```

Build the source code with make.

```
$ make all
```

After building the source code sucessfully, you should see two executable programs:

- `ontology`: the node program/command line program for node control
- `tools/sigsvr`: (optional)Ontology Signature Server - sigsvr is a rpc server for signing transactions for some special requirement.detail docs can be reference at [link](./docs/specifications/sigsvr.md)

### Get from release
- You can download latest ontology binary file with ` curl https://dev.ont.io/ontology_install | sh `.

- You can download other version at [release page](https://github.com/ontio/ontology/releases).

## Server deployment
### Select network
To run Ontology successfully,  nodes can be deployed by three ways:

- Mainnet sync node deployment
- Public test network Polaris sync node deployment
- Single-host deployment
- Multi-hosts deployment

#### Mainnet sync node deployment

Run ontology straightly

   ```
	./ontology --networkid 1
   ```


#### Public test network Polaris sync node deployment

Run ontology straightly

   ```
	./ontology --networkid 2
   ```


#### Single-host deployment configuration

Create a directory on the host and store the following files in the directory:
- Node program + Node control program  `ontology`
- Wallet file`wallet.dat`

Run command `$ ./ontology --testmode --networkid 3` can start single-host test net.

Here's a example of single-host configuration:

- Directory structure

    ```shell
    $ tree
    └── ontology
        ├── ontology
        └── wallet.dat
    ```

#### Multi-hosts deployment configuration

Note: When you want to build a private net to run ontology in DBFT or VBFT, you must use --config argument to specify a configuration file, and
use --networkid to define a net work identity of your network(not equals 1/2/3), otherwise the node will link to mainnet by default.

##### VBFT Deployment

In the multi-hosts enviroment, we need 7 nodes to run ontology at least in VBFT.

We can perform a quick deployment by modifying the configuration file [`config-vbft.json`](./docs/specifications/config-vbft.json), 
click [here](./docs/specifications/config.md) to read instruction of config file.

1. Generate 7 wallet file, each wallet contains an account. These account is bookkeepers of consensus. The account generated by :
	```
	./ontology account add -d -w wallet.dat
	Use default setting '-t ecdsa -b 256 -s SHA256withECDSA' 
		signature algorithm: ecdsa 
		curve: P-256 
		signature scheme: SHA256withECDSA 
	Password:
	Re-enter Password:

	Index: 1
	Label: 
	Address: AXkDGfr9thEqWmCKpTtQYaazJRwQzH48eC
	Public key: 03d7d8c0c4ca2d2bc88209db018dc0c6db28380d8674aff86011b2a6ca32b512f9
	Signature scheme: SHA256withECDSA

	Create account successfully.
	```
    use -w argument to define wallet file name.

2. Modify `config-vbft.json`, set public key and address of 7 accounts generated in last step into peers config in `config-vbft.json`.

3. Copy related file into target host, including:

   - A configuration file`config-vbft.json`
   - Node program`ontology`
   - wallet file
   
4. Set the network connection port number for each node (recommend using the default port configuration, instead of modifying)

   - `NodePort`is P2P connection port number (default: 20338)
   - `HttpJsonPort` and `HttpLocalPort` are RPC port numbers (default: 20336, 20337)

5. Seed nodes configuration

   - Select at least one seed node out of 7 hosts and fill the seed node address into the `SeelList` of each configuration file. The format is `Seed node IP address + Seed node NodePort`.

##### DBFT Deployment

In the multi-hosts enviroment, we need 4 nodes to run ontology at least in DBFT.

We can perform a quick deployment by modifying the configuration file [`config-dbft.json`](./docs/specifications/config-dbft.json),
 click [here](./docs/specifications/config.md) to read 
 instruction of config file.
1. Copy related file into target host, including:
  
     - Configuration file`config-dbft.json`
     - Node program`ontology`
     
2. Set the network connection port number for each node (recommend using the default port configuration, instead of modifying)

   - `NodePort`is P2P connection port number (default: 20338)
   - `HttpJsonPort` and `HttpLocalPort` are RPC port numbers (default: 20336, 20337)

3. Seed nodes configuration
  
      - Select at least one seed node out of 4 hosts and fill the seed node address into the `SeelList` of each configuration file. The format is `Seed node IP address + Seed node NodePort`.

4. Create wallet file

   - Through command line program, on each host create wallet wallet.dat needed for node implementation.
        ```
        ./ontology account add -d -w wallet.dat
        Use default setting '-t ecdsa -b 256 -s SHA256withECDSA' 
        signature algorithm: ecdsa 
        curve: P-256 
        signature scheme: SHA256withECDSA 
        Password:
        Re-enter Password:
            
        Index: 1
        Label: 
        Address: AXkDGfr9thEqWmCKpTtQYaazJRwQzH48eC
        Public key: 03d7d8c0c4ca2d2bc88209db018dc0c6db28380d8674aff86011b2a6ca32b512f9
        Signature scheme: SHA256withECDSA
            
        Create account successfully.
        ```

5. Bookkeepers configuration

   - While creating a wallet for each node, the public key information of the wallet will be displayed. Fill in the public key information of all nodes in the `Bookkeepers` field of each node's configuration file.

     Note: The public key information for each node's wallet can also be viewed via the command line program:

        ```
        1	AYiToLDT2yZuNs3PZieXcdTpyC5VWQmfaN (default)
        	Label: 
        	Signature algorithm: ECDSA
        	Curve: P-256
        	Key length: 384 bits
        	Public key: 030e5d50bf585ff5c73464114244b93f04b231862d6bbdfd846be890093b2c1c17
        	Signature scheme: SHA256withECDSA
        ```

#### Deploy Completed

Now multi-host configuration is completed, directory structure of each node is as follows:

   ```shell
	$ ls
	config.json ontology wallet.dat
   ```

### Implement

Run each node program in any order and enter the node's wallet password after the `Password:` prompt appears.

If you wish to run a consensus node (such as in a private net), the --enableconsensus argument must be used. If you want to run
a private net, use --networkid argument to specify your net work identify（not equals 1/2/3） and use --config argument to specify your configuration
file.

such as:
   ```
    $ ./ontology --enableconsensus --networkid 4 --config ./config.json
    $ - Input your wallet password
   ```

Run `./ontology --help` for details, also you can read [ontology CLI user guide](./docs/specifications/cli_user_guide.md) to get more information.


#### Run in docker

Please ensure there are docker environment in your machine.

1. make docker image

    - In the root directory of source code，run`make docker`, it will make ontology image in docker.

2. run ontology image

    - Use command `docker run ontio/ontology`to run ontology；

    - If you need to allow interactive keyboard input while the image is running, you can use the `docker -ti run ontio/ontology` command to start the image;

    - If you need to keep the data generated by image at runtime, you can refer to the data persistence function of docker (e.g. valume);

    - If you need to add ontology parameters, you can add them directly after `docker run ontio/ontology` such as `docker run ontio/ontology --networkid 2`.
     The parameters of ontology command line refer to [here](./docs/specifications/cli_user_guide.md).

### ONT transfer sample
 -- from: transfer from； -- to: transfer to； -- amount: ont amount；
```shell
  ./ontology asset transfer  --to=AXkDGfr9thEqWmCKpTtQYaazJRwQzH48eC --amount=10
```
If transfer asset successd, the result will show as follow:

```
Transfer ONT
From:TA6edvwgNy3c1nBHgmFj8KrgQ1JCJNhM3o
To:TA4Xe9j8VbU4m3T1zEa1uRiMTauiAT88op
Amount:10
TxHash:10dede8b57ce0b272b4d51ab282aaf0988a4005e980d25bd49685005cc76ba7f
```
TxHash is the transfer transaction hash, we can query transfer result by txhash.
Because of generate block time, the transfer transaction will not execute befer at least generate one block.

### Query transfer status sample

--hash:transfer transaction hash
```shell
./ontology asset status --hash=10dede8b57ce0b272b4d51ab282aaf0988a4005e980d25bd49685005cc76ba7f
```
result：
```shell
Transaction:transfer success
From:AXkDGfr9thEqWmCKpTtQYaazJRwQzH48eC
To:AYiToLDT2yZuNs3PZieXcdTpyC5VWQmfaN
Amount:10
```

### Query account balance sample

--address: account address

```shell
./ontology asset balance --address=AYiToLDT2yZuNs3PZieXcdTpyC5VWQmfaN
```
result：
```shell
BalanceOf:AYiToLDT2yZuNs3PZieXcdTpyC5VWQmfaN
ONT:10
ONG:0
ONGApprove:0
```
